# cbmcmc
MCMC Algorithm for Gaussian Graphical Models using Cycle Bases

To replicate the experiment results presented in the manuscript, first run
`export PYTHONPATH=:$(pwd):$PYTHONPATH`
in the current directory and change directory to `breastcancer/`.

Then, the dataset, edge and star cycle basis MCMC estimates, and plots can be obtained by executing the scripts 
named `get_data.r`, `mcmc.py` and `plotting.py`, respectively.
